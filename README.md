Project is near enough finished - First Project using NextJS and TypeScript on my own.

**Take Aways**

As no plan was made before starting this project, next time I will create a clear plan which will help with the below:

-Implementing better types instead of multiple types which could have been simplified.
-Global/ central state management for components and pages that use the WishList and Basket. Did create a branch using Zustand which helped me gain some knowledge of how to
implement. Or I could have used a context for cleaner code. Would have been able to then notify when items are added to basket from multiple different pages.
-More reuseable components which could have been used to reduce the duplication of code.
-API integration to minimize time manually spent gathering images, descriptions etc. Also would have been useful for a Trade-In Feature.
